# GKE personal
Terraform files that define a Kubernetes cluster on GKE costing < $2 month running my personal projects

This cluser was created to give me hands-on experience with running a K8 cluster with minimal cost, and as such it *does not* follow best practices.
To minimize cost, the cluster only contains a single node, and as such, the benefit of K8 (HA, fault-tolerence etc.) is not found.
